    <h1>Welcome to {{ appName }}</h1>
    <p>
      To get started, go to the 'Records' screen and choose from the buttons below to record an observation or start a
      koala
      census. An observation is a one-off recording of a koala sighting at a particular location. A census is part of a
      systematic survey that is generally conducted at a defined site. The census method recorded by this app is the
      Spot
      Assessment Technique (SAT) (Phillips and Callaghan, 2011). 'Trees searched' are always part of the SAT census and
      record the individual tree species, at a site, that have been searched for koalas and their scats.

      Uploading Records
    </h2>
    <p>
      When one or more records have been completed, you can upload them to the server by clicking the upload
      button. Completed records (shown in green) are those where all required fields are entered and within
      the allowable constraints. You can still upload completed records even if some are incomplete
      (shown in blue). Incomplete records will not be uploaded.
